Hello Martina,

I'm glad to hear that you got interested in my work!
Indeed, most of my work is in web development focused on front-end (html5 + css3) that access the back-end through a REST API (mostly developed using Laravel Framework - PHP). I'm currently developing a blog system inspired in Medium (see http://molog.us/). I also won some prizes at Hackathons such as TNW (3rd place in general and 1st place in Deezer challenge), API Hack Day (made by SendGrid - 1st place with vMail project), FirefoxOS hackathon (2nd place in general), Hackathon Livre (made by Mercado Livre - similar to eBay - 1st place with eShelf project), etc.

Right now, I'm associated at a startup called InEvent (http://inevent.us/). We provide a brand-new experience to congressmen in events (such as entrepreneurship events, hackathons, fairs, etc).

Since I will probably go to the USA in July/August and I'm not available right now to move and work in USA (I'm only available to visit USA until February), we could keep in touch and talk a little more when I'm there. I don't know the urgency of your company on hiring a Javascript developer, but unfortunatelly I can't accept the invite right now (in fact I'm studying computer engineering at University of SÃ£o Paulo).

So what do you say, could we keep in touch until then? (It would be great to hear more about your company).
